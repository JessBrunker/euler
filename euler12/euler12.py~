'''
The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural
numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be:
    1+2+3+4+5+6+7=28

The first ten such terms are:
    1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Listing the factors of the triangle numbers, 28 is the first to have
over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five
hundred divisors?
